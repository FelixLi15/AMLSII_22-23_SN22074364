# Aim
  The aim of this project is to investigate and explore in detail the application of generative adversarial networks using a residual network generator for image super-resolution restoration tasks. This project focus on the structure and training process of the residual network generator, and its role in generative adversarial networks. Through experimental validation and analysis of results, we will evaluate the performance of the method on a variety of super-resolution restoration datasets.
# Files
  datasets.py is used to provide functions for image related processing, such as cropping, downsampling, generating high and low resolution image pairs. models.py is used to store the network structure and related parameters for residual networks, generative adversarial networks. main.py is used for training and validation of the models.
# Required Library
Pillow==9.5.0
